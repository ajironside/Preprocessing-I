                of customer service experience in a wide variety of situations. I have used software such as Citrix for healthcare documentation and retail ticket tracking applications. I am a quick learner and excited expand my skill set. I have a foundational
                knowledge of object oriented programming and markup languages such as HTML and CSS. I am currently learning C++ in my spare time.</p>
